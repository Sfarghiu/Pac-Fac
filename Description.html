            <p> This website is part of a project that aims to bring the wonderful game of Pac-Man to the
"Alexandru Ioan Cuza" University. </p>
            <p> This project was created by Vladut Cojocariu, Sabina Savescu, Andrei Arhip and Andrei Safrghiu,
under the guidance of their professor Ciprian Amariei. </p>
            <p> This project aims to recreate the legendary game of Pac-Man, but with a twist: the levels are
inspired by the the computer science building layout, the users will be able to connect using
various social accounts, the power-ups are student-themed (cheat-sheets, smart-watches etc.),
the ghosts are professors, and a whole lot more. </p>
            <p> We gladly present to you</p>
