    <br><p> This website is part of a project that aims to bring the wonderful game of Pac-Man to the
    "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" University. </p>
    <p> This project was created by Vl&abreve;du&tcedil; Cojocariu, Sabina S&abreve;vescu, Andrei Arhip and Andrei Sfarghiu,
        under the guidance of their professor Ciprian Amariei. </p>
        <p> This project aims to recreate the legendary game of Pac-Man, but with a twist: the levels are
            inspired by the computer science building layout, the users will be able to connect using
            various social accounts, the power-ups are student-themed (cheat-sheets, smart-watches etc.),
            the ghosts are professors, and a whole lot more. </p>
            <p> We gladly present to you</p>
